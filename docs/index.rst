   .. tab-item:: HTTPS

        Installation through GitHub HTTPS is the easiest and most common option. This can be done through the terminal or via the website as listed.

        .. code-block:: terminal

                git clone https://github.com/GH-Syn/Escapade.git

   .. tab-item:: SSH

        SSH is a better alternative to HTTPS if you are already set up to configure SSH. Additionally, if you are looking to contribute to the game, please download via SSH as this is more secure.

        .. code-block:: terminal

                git clone git@github.com:GH-Syn/Escapade.git

   .. tab-item:: GitHub CLI

        If you have the GitHub client installed, you can run the following command to locally install Escapade to your machine.

        .. code-block:: terminal

                gh repo clone GH-Syn/Escapade
